## #TODO :green_circle: Start Here: Press **V** to view this card!

Each card is a task that will help you get familiar with imdone.

If you'd rather just start using imdone, you can add your own project by pressing **command** or **control** + **N**.

<!-- The {{icons.kebab}} is a property that is set in the custom properties file .imdone/properties/card.js -->
You can also open the main menu by clicking the {{icons.kebab}} on your top left and click the ***Add a project*** menu item.

### Moving cards

1. If you're still in the focus view, move this card to **DOING** by pressing **shift** + :arrow_right: or change the list to **DOING** in the dropdown to the right.
2. Go back to the board by pressing **esc** or clicking the **X** above and to the right.
3. Now move this card to **DONE** by dragging it to the DONE list or pressing **shift** + :arrow_right:.

## #TODO :link: Use filter URL variables in your cards

Learn how to use Imdone's filter URL variables for dynamic links in your cards.

### :mag: What They Do

- **`{{getFilterURL(filter)}`** – Inserts a URL that applies the given filter.
- **`{{getFilterLink(filter)}`** – Inserts a Markdown link that applies the filter, using the filter as the link text.
- **`{{clearFilterURL}`** – Inserts a URL that clears the filter.

### :hammer_and_wrench: How to Use Them in Cards

#### Getting a Filter URL

----

##### Example

> View all TODO tasks [here]({{getFilterURL('list:TODO')}}).

##### Markdown

```markdown
View all TODO tasks [here]({{getFilterURL('list:TODO')}}).
```

#### Creating a Filter Link

----

##### Example

> See all TODO tasks: {{getFilterLink('list:TODO')}}

##### Markdown

```markdown
See all TODO tasks: {{getFilterLink('list:TODO')}}
```

#### Clearing Filters

----

##### Example

> Click [here]({{clearFilterURL}}) to clear all filters.

##### Markdown

```markdown
Click [here]({{clearFilterURL}}) to clear all filters.
```

### :white_check_mark: Try It Out!

- Add a **clear filter link** to a card using `{{clearFilterURL}}`.
- Create a **DOING filter URL** with `{{getFilterURL('list:DOING')}}`.
- Generate a **DOING filter link** with `{{getFilterLink('list:DOING')}}`.

:rocket: Now, test these in your Imdone board and watch them work dynamically!
