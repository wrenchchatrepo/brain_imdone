## Color Selection Rationale
- Pastel colors chosen for reduced eye strain
- Each status has distinct but harmonious color
- Priority colors follow intuitive progression
- UI colors maintain professional appearance

## Implementation Details
1. Status Colors:
   - Backlog to Done follows logical progression
   - Special statuses have distinct colors
   - All colors tested for visibility

2. Priority Colors:
   - Red variant for high priority
   - Yellow variant for medium priority
   - Green variant for low priority

3. UI Elements:
   - White background for cards
   - Light gray for structural elements
   - Consistent shadow effects

## Future Considerations
- Consider seasonal color themes
- Potential dark mode adaptation
- Custom color scheme options
- Color blindness accessibility
