## Overview
These notes compile research on different knowledge management systems and approaches that could inform future enhancements to the brain system.

## Key Systems Reviewed

### 1. Zettelkasten Method
- **Core Concept**: Atomic notes with unique identifiers
- **Strengths**: 
  - Encourages making connections between ideas
  - Supports non-linear thinking
  - Scales well with large amounts of information
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Steep learning curve
  - Requires discipline to maintain
- **Potential Applications**: Could enhance our linking between cards

### 2. PARA Method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
- **Core Concept**: Organizing information by actionability
- **Strengths**:
  - Clear organizational structure
  - Focuses on actionable information
  - Easy to understand and implement
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Sometimes difficult to categorize information
  - Can lead to duplication
- **Potential Applications**: Could inform our archiving strategy

### 3. Building a Second Brain (BASB)
- **Core Concept**: Personal knowledge management system
- **Strengths**:
  - Comprehensive approach to capturing and organizing information
  - CODE methodology (Capture, Organize, Distill, Express)
  - Project-focused
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Can be overwhelming for beginners
  - Requires multiple tools
- **Potential Applications**: Could enhance our project organization

## Synthesis
The brain system already incorporates elements from these approaches:
- Card IDs (similar to Zettelkasten)
- Project organization (similar to PARA)
- Capture and organization workflows (similar to BASB)

## Recommendations
1. Enhance linking between cards to better support a Zettelkasten-like approach
2. Consider implementing a more structured archiving system based on PARA
3. Add distillation features to help summarize and extract key insights
4. Improve expression capabilities for sharing knowledge
