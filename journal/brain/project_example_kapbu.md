## Project Overview
This project aims to implement several high-priority enhancements to the brain system, focusing on search capabilities, mobile compatibility, and external tool integrations.

## Objectives
- Improve information retrieval with advanced search
- Enable access to the brain system from mobile devices
- Connect the brain system with external productivity tools
- Enhance visualization of tasks and projects

## Deliverables
1. Advanced search feature with filtering and saved searches
2. Mobile-responsive interface for the brain system
3. Integrations with calendar and email systems
4. Enhanced visualization tools (Gantt charts, burndown charts)
5. Documentation and training materials

## Timeline
- **Phase 1 (June 25 - July 15)**: Advanced search implementation
- **Phase 2 (July 16 - August 5)**: Mobile compatibility
- **Phase 3 (August 6 - August 25)**: External integrations
- **Phase 4 (August 26 - August 30)**: Final testing and documentation

## Resources
- Development team: 2 developers
- Design support: 1 designer (part-time)
- Testing: 1 QA specialist
- Budget: $15,000

## Dependencies
- Completion of the archiving system
- Access to external APIs for integration
- User feedback on current search limitations

## Risks
- External API changes could impact integrations
- Mobile compatibility may require significant UI changes
- Search performance with large number of cards

## Status Updates
- **June 15, 2023**: Project planning initiated
- **June 20, 2023**: Requirements gathering completed
