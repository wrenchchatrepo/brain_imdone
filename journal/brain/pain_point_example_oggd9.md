## Issue Description
Users are experiencing significant delays when searching through the brain system when it contains more than 500 cards. Search operations that should be nearly instantaneous are taking 5-10 seconds to complete, causing frustration and reducing productivity.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create or import at least 500 cards into the system
2. Open the search interface
3. Enter a search term that will match multiple cards
4. Observe the delay before results appear

## Current Impact
This issue is affecting all users with large card collections, particularly those who have been using the system for several months. The slow search performance is:
- Causing frustration and reducing user satisfaction
- Discouraging users from searching for information
- Leading some users to create duplicate cards rather than finding existing ones
- Reducing overall productivity and trust in the system

## Affected Components
- Search functionality in the UI
- Backend search implementation
- Card indexing system
- Filter operations

## Potential Solutions
- Implement a more efficient search algorithm
- Add proper indexing for card content and metadata
- Consider using a dedicated search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch)
- Implement pagination for search results
- Add caching for frequent searches

## Workarounds
Users can currently work around this issue by:
- Using more specific search terms
- Filtering by project or tag before searching
- Limiting searches to specific directories
- Using external search tools (e.g., grep) directly on the markdown files

## Related Cards
- Implement Search Feature (7rt2q)
- Brain System Enhancement Project (kapbu)

## Additional Context
Performance testing shows that search time increases exponentially with the number of cards. At 100 cards, search takes less than 1 second, but at 500 cards it takes 5-10 seconds, and at 1000 cards it can take up to 30 seconds.

The current implementation reads and parses all card files for each search operation, which is inefficient. A proper indexing system would significantly improve performance.
