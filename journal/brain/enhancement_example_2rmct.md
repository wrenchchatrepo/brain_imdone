## Enhancement Description
The brain system currently works well on desktop devices but has limited usability on mobile devices. This enhancement aims to create a responsive design that works well on smartphones and tablets, allowing users to access and update their tasks from any device.

## Current Behavior
The interface is designed for desktop screens and does not adapt well to smaller screens. Text is difficult to read, buttons are too small to tap, and the Kanban board layout breaks on narrow screens.

## Desired Behavior
A fully responsive interface that:
- Automatically adapts to different screen sizes
- Provides touch-friendly controls on mobile devices
- Maintains all functionality across devices
- Offers optimized views for different screen orientations
- Provides a seamless experience when switching between devices

## Benefits
- Increased accessibility for users on the go
- Ability to capture thoughts and tasks from anywhere
- Improved user satisfaction and adoption
- Competitive advantage over similar systems
- Support for modern work patterns (remote, hybrid)

## Implementation Ideas
- Use responsive CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind)
- Implement a mobile-first design approach
- Create alternative layouts for different screen sizes
- Optimize touch targets for mobile interaction
- Implement progressive web app (PWA) capabilities for offline use

## Potential Challenges
- Maintaining feature parity across all devices
- Ensuring performance on lower-powered mobile devices
- Handling complex interactions (drag-and-drop) on touch screens
- Testing across a wide range of devices and browsers

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Interface elements properly resize and reflow on screens from 320px to 2560px wide
- [ ] All functionality works on touch devices without requiring a mouse
- [ ] Performance testing shows acceptable load times on mobile connections
- [ ] User testing confirms intuitive operation on mobile devices
- [ ] Accessibility standards are maintained across all screen sizes

## Notes
Initial mockups have been created by the design team and are available in the shared design repository. User research indicates this is the most requested enhancement from current users.
