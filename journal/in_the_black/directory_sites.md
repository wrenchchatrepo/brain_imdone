Key Points:

1) First, find your niche:
• Use Ahrefs "near me" searches

• Target keyword difficulty under 20
• Avoid seasonal/branded keywords
• Find niches with fragmented search intent

2) Validate your idea:
• Check competition on Google

• Browse Reddit discussions
• Confirm real user pain points
• Set a "bounty" on weak competitors

3) Data Collection Strategy:

• Collect key data points:

Name, address, phone
Reviews & ratings
Hours & location links
Street view images

4) Data Enrichment 
• Add unique features competitors lack
• Include amenity details (shade, benches, etc)
• Use AI tools to automate enrichment
• Focus on solving specific user problems
• Make data actually USEFUL

5) Building The Directory:

• Target city-specific keywords
• Include:

Table of contents
Location details
Embedded maps
Reviews
Internal linking structure

6) Monetization Options
