Description:
- Purpose: Develop a large semantic model for advanced NLP tasks
- Scope: Build, train, and deploy a large-scale semantic model
- Repository: https://github.com/wrenchchatrepo/heuristicsai

Tasks:
- [ ] Define model architecture and requirements
- [ ] Set up training infrastructure
- [ ] Prepare training and validation datasets
- [ ] Implement model training pipeline
- [ ] Develop evaluation metrics and benchmarks
- [ ] Optimize model performance
- [ ] Create deployment strategy
- [ ] Document model capabilities and limitations

Notes:
- Consider computational requirements for training
- Explore transfer learning from existing models
- Focus on domain-specific adaptations
